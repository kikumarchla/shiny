# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.
# lintr provides static code analysis for R.
# It checks for adherence to a given style,
# identifying syntax errors and possible semantic issues,
# then reports them to you so you can take action.
